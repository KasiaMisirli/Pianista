# Pianista

Access the live version [here](https://shrouded-reaches-65280.herokuapp.com/).

## Description

Many pianos are chronically under-played. They sit in cafes, libraries, airports, and other public spaces, while many people who can play them can't commit to owning one.

Pianista is a platform that maps these publicly accessible pianos and allows users to add and comment on pianos wherever in the world they find them.  A React-based first release is currently in development, which will also allow users to comment, add pictures, and embed audio samples of each piano.


## Tools used

Pianista is a Ruby on Rails application. It uses [Geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder) for handling location information. It also uses jQuery, Underscore.js, and RSpec for basic testing. It's currently hosted on Heroku, using the Puma web server.


## Contributors
